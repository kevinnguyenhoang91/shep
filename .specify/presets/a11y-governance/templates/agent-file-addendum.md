## Accessibility Governance Agent Guidance

- Treat `CLI`, `documentation`, `HTML`, `UI`, generated templates, error
  messages, and changelogs as user-facing artefacts that fall under
  accessibility review.
- Apply `WCAG 2.2 Level AA` wherever the criteria fit. Avoid
  colour-dependent signalling and symbols that screen readers or Braille
  displays cannot represent.
- Use `DE first, EN second` for shared guidance and learner-facing
  documentation. Headings follow the bilingual `DE / EN` pattern unless a
  synchronised `*.EN.md` companion is used. Tool names and proper nouns
  are language-neutral exceptions.
- Maintain full German orthography: umlauts (ä, ö, ü, Ä, Ö, Ü) and `ß`
  must never be replaced by ASCII fallbacks (`fur`, `loeschen`, `nao`).
- Aim for CEFR Level B2 in user-facing prose. Define domain terms on
  first use. Add a short DE/EN explanation under every ASCII diagram,
  meaningful table, or graphic.
- Read the project's declared audience before producing learner-facing
  material. Do not assume prior Spec Kit knowledge unless the project
  explicitly declares it. Explain workflow terms at first use, and keep
  dependencies, status, decisions, and next actions available as ordered text
  rather than only as a visual.
- Review new or changed non-trivial logic for didactic inline-code-comment
  value when learning comprehension or maintainability is affected.
- Good didactic comments explain the `why`, trade-off, boundary condition,
  historical deviation, or proof limit. They do not repeat the obvious
  `what` of the code. Normal intensity is 1 to 3 lines before a
  non-trivial block.
- Tag every code block with a language (` ```bash `, ` ```powershell `,
  ` ```text ` for ASCII art / dialogues / directory trees). Bare
  ` ``` ` violates WCAG 4.1.1 (parsing).
- Keep accessibility guidance aligned across `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  `GEMINI.md`, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Document any
  intentional deviation in the same change.
- Document every `N/A` decision with rationale.
- Surface required evidence artefacts under `docs/accessibility/`.

## Audit-Ready Spec-Kit Evidence

- When this preset applies, generated or updated Markdown evidence must include the Spec-Kit run, owner/reviewer, evidence path, applicability decision, N/A rationale where relevant, and open follow-up tracking.
- Do not treat an unfilled starter template as evidence. Evidence exists only after the current run has recorded concrete decisions, paths, and rationale.
