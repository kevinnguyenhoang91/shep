/**
 * Sync Feature Branch Use Case
 *
 * Brings a feature branch in sync with its base branch without ever putting
 * work at risk:
 *
 *   commit work in progress → fetch the base branch from the remote →
 *   rebase the feature branch onto it → delegate conflicts to the agent
 *
 * Uncommitted work is COMMITTED, not stashed. `git stash push` ignores
 * untracked files, so a worktree holding only new files was left dirty and
 * the rebase aborted with "working directory has uncommitted changes"; and a
 * stash that fails to pop leaves work stranded outside the branch. A commit
 * always lands on the branch and is undone with `git reset --soft HEAD~1`.
 *
 * Shared by the manual "Rebase on Main" action and by starting a pending
 * feature, so both surfaces get identical semantics.
